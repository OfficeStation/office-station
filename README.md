Stationery 14 is a fork of [Space Station 14](), which runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox). Stationery focuses on an office set in the space station universe, but instead of terrorists, cults, revolutions(ok, maybe a labour union or two) or a coterie of other threats, there's harsh deadlines and missing your electricity bill.

A common allegory for the events of ss13/14 is a play or tv show - where normal servers would be akin to Star Trek (think DS9 for more serious forks and the Orwell* as sillier ones), Stationery aims to be like The Office, IT crowd, Parks & Rec, ad infinitum.
